# Metacrafters Solidity Token Project

This is a learning project in Solidity developed with the help of metacrafters.io. This project demonstrates a simple token contract without any advanced security features.

# Description
The project includes a SolidityToken.sol file containing the MyToken contract, written in Solidity version 0.8.18. MyToken is a straightforward token contract with the following features:
Public variables for token details: token name, token abbreviation, total token supply.
> A mapping of addresses to token balances.
> A mint function to create new tokens.
> A burn function to destroy existing tokens.
> Both mint and burn functions take an address and a value as parameters. The burn function additionally checks that the address has a sufficient balance to burn the specified amount.
#Getting Started
#Executing the program
This project can be run on any Ethereum network. The following steps outline how to compile and deploy the contract using the Remix IDE:
1. Compile the Contract: Open Remix and load the SolidityToken.sol file. Compile the contract using Solidity version 0.8.18.
2. Deploy the Contract: Deploy the MyToken contract on the Ethereum network of your choice.
3. Interact with the Contract:
  > Retrieve Token Details: Call the tokenName, tokenAbbr, and tokenSupply variables to get the token name ('XelPoints'), token abbreviation ('XP'), and total token supply (initially 0).
  > Mint Tokens: Use the mint function with an address and value to increase the total token supply and the balance of the specified address.
  > Burn Tokens: Use the burn function with an address and value to decrease the total token supply and the balance of the specified address. Ensure the address has a sufficient balance before burning.
  > Verify Changes: Call the tokenSupply variable to confirm the changes in the total token supply after minting or burning tokens.
